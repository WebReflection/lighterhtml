The _hyperHTML_ strength & experience without its complexity 🎉

  * **faster** than [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML) ⚡️
  * **simpler** than [lit-html](https://github.com/polymer/lit-html) 💡
  * fueling this [heresy](https://github.com/WebReflection/heresy/#readme) too 🔥


### faster than hyperHTML

Even if sharing 90% of _hyperHTML_'s code, this utility removed all the not strictly necessary parts from it, including:

  * no `Component`, no `define` and/or intents, no `connect` or `disconnect`, and no promises <sup><sub>(possibly in later on)</sub></sup>, everything these days can be easily handled by hooks, as example using the [dom-augmentor](https://github.com/WebReflection/dom-augmentor) utility
  * html content is never implicit, since all you have to do is to write `html` before any template when you need it. However, the `{html: string}` is still accepted for extreme cases.

Removing these parts made the output smaller in size <sup><sub>(less than 6K)</sub></sup> but it also simplified some underlying logic.

Accordingly, _lighterhtml_ delivers raw [domdiff](https://github.com/WebReflection/domdiff#domdiff) and [domtagger](https://github.com/WebReflection/domtagger#domtagger) performance in an optimized way.

If you don't believe it, check the [DBMonster](https://webreflection.github.io/lighterhtml/test/dbmonster.html) benchmark 😉


### simpler than lit-html

In _lit-html_, the `html` function tag is worthless, if used without its `render`.

In _lighterhtml_ though, the `html` tag can be used in the wild to create any, one-off, real DOM, [as shown in this pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/jXdJBR?editors=0010).

```js
// lighterhtml: import the `html` tag and use it right away
import {html} from '//unpkg.com/lighterhtml?module';

// a one off, safe, runtime list 👍
const list = ['some', '<b>nasty</b>', 'list'];
document.body.appendChild(html`
  <ul>${list.map(text => html`
    <li>${text}</li>
  `)}
  </ul>
`);
```

Strawberry on top, when the `html` or `svg` tag is used through _lighterhtml_ `render`, it automatically creates all the keyed performance you'd expect from _hyperHTML_ wires, without needing to manually address any reference: pain point? defeated! 🍾

"_but ... how?_", if you're asking, the answer is simple: _lighterhtml_ is based on the same [augmentor](https://github.com/WebReflection/augmentor#augmentor)'s hooks concept, followed by automatically addressed [hyperhtml-wire](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperhtml-wire#hyperhtml-wire)s, which in turns brings a battle tested solution for the [O(ND) Eugene W. Myers' Algorithm](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.4.6927&rep=rep1&type=pdf) based [domdiff](https://github.com/WebReflection/domdiff#domdiff), and its extra variations.


### Available as lighterhtml-plus too!

Born just as own fork of this project, `lighterhtml-plus` enhances the HTML5 experience through these extras:

  * `onconnected` callback, as in [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML#hyperhtml), to have Custom Elements like callbacks
  * `ondisconnected` callback, as in [hyperHTML](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML#hyperhtml), to have counter events when nodes get disconnected
  * `onattributechanged` callback, as in [wickedElements](https://github.com/WebReflection/wicked-elements#wickedelements), to have attributes change notifications, Custom Elements like


### How to import lighterhtml/-plus

Following, the usual multi import pattern behind every project of mine:

  * via global `lighterhtml` CDN utility: `<script src="https://unpkg.com/lighterhtml"></script>`, and `const {render, html, svg} = lighterhtml`
  * via ESM CDN module: `import {render, html, svg} from 'https://unpkg.com/lighterhtml?module'`
  * via ESM bundler: `import {render, html, svg} from 'lighterhtml'`
  * via CJS module: `const {render, html, svg} = require('lighterhtml')`


### What's the API ? What's in the export ?

The module exports the following:

  * `html` tag function, create as one-off any sort of html content, or wired content when used within a `render` call
  * `svg` tag function, create as one-off any sort of SVG content, or wired content when used within a `render` call
  * `render(node, fn)` to pollute a `node` with whatever is returned from the `fn` parameters, including `html` or `svg` tagged layout, as well as any real DOM content, if needed
  * `hook(useRef)` that returns hooks compatible `html` and `svg` utilities, using a `useRef(null)` reference to provide a keyed updated per each component
  * `Hole` class for 3rd parts (internal use)

You can test live a `hook` example in [this Code Pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/maQXwq?editors=0010).


### What's different from hyperHTML ?

  * the wired content is not strongly referenced as it is for `hyperHTML.wire(ref[, type:id])` **unless** you explicitly ask for it via `html.for(ref[, id])` or `svg.for(ref[, id])`, where in both cases, the `id` doesn't need any colon to be unique, and it's the string `default` when not specified. This makes content hard wired whenever it's needed.
  * the `ref=${object}` attribute works same as React, you pass an object via `const obj = useRef(null)` and you'll have `obj.current` on any effect. If you'll pass `{set current(node) { ... }}` that'll be invoked per each update, in case you need the node outside `useRef`.
  * intents, hence `define`, are not implemented. Most tasks can be achieved via hooks.
  * promises are not in neither. You can update asynchronously anything via hooks or via custom element forced updates. Promises might be supported again in the future to align with isomorphic SSR, but right now these are not handled at all.
  * the `onconnected` and `ondisconnected` special events are gone. These might come back in the future but right now _dom-augmentor_ replaces these via `useEffect(callback, [])`. Please note the empty array as second argument.
  * an array of functions will be called automatically, like functions are already called when found in the wild
  * the `Component` can be easily replaced with hooks or automatic keyed renders

```js
const {render, html} = lighterhtml;

// all it takes to have components with lighterhtml
const Comp = (name) => html`<p>Hello ${name}!</p>`;

// for demo purpose, check in console keyed updates
// meaning you won't see a single change per second
setInterval(
  greetings,
  1000,
  [
    'Arianna',
    'Luca',
    'Isa'
  ]
);

function greetings(users) {
  render(document.body, () => html`${users.map(Comp)}`);
}
```

### Documentation

Excluding the already mentioned removed parts, everything else within the template literal works as described in [hyperHTML documentation](https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/#essentials-3-1).


### A basic example

Live on [Code Pen](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/jXdBLV?editors=0010).

```js
import {render, html} from '//unpkg.com/lighterhtml?module';

document.body.appendChild(
  // as unkeyed one-off content, right away 🎉
  html`<strong>any</strong> one-off content!<div/>`
);

// as automatically rendered wired content 🤯
todo(document.body.lastChild);
function todo(node, items = []) {
  render(node, () => html`
  <ul>${items.map((what, i) => html`
    <li data-i=${i} onclick=${remove}> ${what} </li>
  `)}
    <button onclick=${add}> add </button>
  </ul>`);
  function add() {
    items.push(prompt('do'));
    todo(node, items);
  }
  function remove(e) {
    items.splice(e.currentTarget.dataset.i, 1);
    todo(node, items);
  }
}
```


### What about Custom Elements ?

**[You got 'em](https://codepen.io/WebReflection/pen/MZxYVm?editors=0010)**, just bind `render` arguments once and update the element content whenever you feel like.

Compatible with the node itself, or its shadow root, either opened or closed.

```js
const {render, html} = lighterhtml;

customElements.define('my-ce', class extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {yup: 0, nope: 0};
    this.render = render.bind(
      // used as update callback context
      this,
      // used as target node
      // it could either be the node itself
      // or its shadow root, even a closed one
      this.attachShadow({mode: 'closed'}),
      // the update callback
      this.render
    );
    // first render
    this.render();
  }
  render() {
    const {yup, nope} = this.state;
    return html`
    Isn't this <strong>awesome</strong>?
    <hr>
    <button data-key=yup onclick=${this}>yup ${yup}</button>
    <button data-key=nope onclick=${this}>nope ${nope}</button>`;
  }
  handleEvent(event) {
    this[`on${event.type}`](event);
  }
  onclick(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    const {key} = event.currentTarget.dataset;
    this.state[key]++;
    this.render();
  }
});
```


### Should I ditch hyperHTML ?

Born [at the beginning of 2017](https://medium.com/@WebReflection/hyperhtml-a-virtual-dom-alternative-279db455ee0e), _hyperHTML_ matured so much that no crucial bugs have appeared for a very long time.

It has also been used in production to deliver [HyperHTMLElement](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML-Element#hyperhtml-element) components to ~100M users, or to show [W3C specifications](https://github.com/w3c/respec), so that in case of bugs, _hyperHTML_ will most likely be on the fast lane for bug fixes, and _lighterhtml_ will eventually follow, whenever it's needed.

On top of this, all modules used in _lighterhtml_ are part of _hyperHTML_ core, and the [./tagger.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/lighterhtml/blob/master/esm/tagger.js) file is mostly a copy and paste of the _hyperHTML_ [./objects/Update.js](https://github.com/WebReflection/hyperHTML/blob/master/esm/objects/Updates.js) one.

However, as tech and software evolve, I wanted to see if squashing together everything I know about template literals, thanks to _hyperHTML_ development, and everything I've recently learned about hooks, could've been merged together to deliver the easiest way ever to declare any non-virtual DOM view on the Web.

And this is what _lighterhtml_ is about, an attempt to simplify to the extreme the `.bind(...)` and `.wire(...)` concept of _hyperHTML_, through a package that requires pretty much zero knowledge about those internals.

_lighterhtml_ is also relatively new, so that some disabled functionality might come back, or slightly change, but if you like the idea, and you have tested it works for your project, feel free to ditch _hyperHTML_ in favor of _lighterhtml_, so that you can help maturing this project too.
